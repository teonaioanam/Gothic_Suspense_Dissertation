as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the
melancholy House of Usher.

I know not how it was--but, with the
first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom
pervaded my spirit.

I say insufferable; for the feeling was
unrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable, because poetic,
sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest
natural images of the desolate or terrible.

I looked upon the
scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape
features of the domain--

upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant
eye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white
trunks of decayed trees

--with an utter depression of soul which I
can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the
after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into
everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil."
